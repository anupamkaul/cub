Syntax based on constructs:

Tests for for-loops:
1. show different spaces around for symbols (pass and fail)
2. show different characters before for (bfor, before, b for, b-for, forb, (for, for(, (for) etc)
3. show nested for loops (with variable scope)
4. show for loop in a function call
5. show incomplete for loops
6. for for (etc) 
7. for i = 1 to for (etc)
8. fo r i = 1 to .. (etc)

Tests for function calls:
1. print (args)  [space after print should make it an ident and error out]
2. print(<expression>) like if .. (should work if if-syntax is correct)
3. for( )   .. is a for loop not a function call
4. to( ) ... is incorrect as to is a keyword
5. do( ) ... is a do loop and not an overridable function call
6. nested function calls
7. show spaces in and around function calls with pass and fail cases


Test for if statements:
