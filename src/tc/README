The main file is semant.c (function tc_main()) 

It calls parseASTExp(symtab_v, symtab_t, AST_root);

- This takes the AST (at root, generated from previous phase) and starts parsing it for the next steps:
(for all A_Exp type), for that particular A_Exp:
 -- semantic analysis and type check
 -- error corrections
 -- symbol table creation and lookup 
 -- any other register optimizations etc

The output from this overall phase is calling out errors during type checking
and preparing for the IR representation next.
