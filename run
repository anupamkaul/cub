# run script to check tiger's health
# ----------------------------------

# uncomment this line and comment rest of the stuff to have
# a constant test run, like so: 

#./tiger ./tests/test_input1 1>out 2>&1

# or use this part and explicitly pass the test you want to
# run with tiger. In both cases, out, ldump.txt and ydump.txt should
# get generated, depending on the flags set in the makefile (or when
# creating 'tparse' in the AST)

./tiger $1 1>out 2>&1 ; cat out
